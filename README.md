# Node Autorun Tool

## General idea

I was annoyed with how MacOSX works with Autostart. so I decided to build an app that does this for me.

## Features

- dashboard located at port 3001
- Logs for Completed Scripts
- Manual Execution of Scripts

## Wishlist

- Automatic Server Starts. (something like Node-Red or smth)
- Better log overview (ATM the global log doesn't show the names of the scripts etc)
