# Node Autorun Tool

## General idea

I was annoyed with how MacOSX works with Autostart. so I decided to build an app that does this for me.

## Disclaimer
- this is a app that was Designed to be used by me. So I didnt bother adding any logic for user detection
so if you want this to work on your machine you have to manualy set the folder containing the autorunScripts in the constants.ts file

## Features

- dashboard located at port 3001
- Logs for Completed Scripts
- Manual Execution of Scripts

## Wishlist

- Automatic Server Starts. (something like Node-Red or smth)
- Better log overview (ATM the global log doesn't show the names of the scripts etc)
